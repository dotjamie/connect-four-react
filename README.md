## This is a basic one-player Connect Four game

It'd be cool to see different ways to build this whether it's different React or JS approaches or another language - I'd be happy to add to the project if you are up for it! See below for directions to get it up and running on your computer:  

Run the following commands in your terminal:

1) Create a new folder on your local system (ex: `mkdir new-folder-name`)

2) `cd new-folder-name`

3) Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/dotjamie/connect-four-react.git`

4) Run `cd connect-four`

5) Run `npm install`

6) Run `npm start` to start server

7) If a new browser window doesn't open automatically visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Have fun!
