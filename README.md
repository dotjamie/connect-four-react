## This project is a basic one-player Connect Four game

It'd be cool to see different ways to build this whether it's different React or JS approaches or another language - I'd be happy to add to the project if you are up for it!   

1) Create a new folder on your local system (ex: `mkdir new-folder-name` in terminal)

2) `cd new-folder-name` in terminal

3) Download connect-four folder via dropbox link

4) Run `cd connect-four` in terminal

5) Run `npm install` in terminal

6) Run `npm start` to start server

7) If a new browser window doesn't open automatically visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Have fun!
